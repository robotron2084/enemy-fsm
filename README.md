# Enemy FSM

Attempting to build my own generic FSM setup with the following criteria:
  * Unity Support
  * Unity Editor Support
  * Use either `async Task` or standard functions.
  * Based on Functional Core, Imperative Shell.
  * Using a lightweight reflection to allow for lightweight setup.

Not looking for
  * Nested structures.
  * Triggers

Future Goals
  * Unitask support.
  * Make it a package.

Early days, check out the code if you like! This is an experiment to see how well the above things mix. I have a feeling they might work well together. We'll see!
